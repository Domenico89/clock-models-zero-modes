The Mathematica file Functions.nb contains all the major functions that allow the manipulation and the construction of zero modes for quantum clock models. In particular all the functions up to PrintLefRightVector can be used for all clock models, while the following functions concentrate on the case of a clock model with three spin values.

The folders SolutionPi6/ and SolutionPi12/ contain the solutions for teh zero mode expansions for \theta=Pi/6 and \theta=Pi/12. In both cases \phi=0.
