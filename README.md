The Mathematica file Functions.nb contains all the major functions that allow the manipulation and the construction of zero modes for quantum clock models. In particular all the functions up to PrintLefRightVector can be used for all clock models, while the following functions concentrate on the case of a clock model with three spin values.

The Mathematica file Example.nb contains an example on how to compute the zero mode and normalize it correctly.

The folders SolutionPi6/ and SolutionPi12/ contain the solutions for the zero mode expansions for \theta=Pi/6 and \theta=Pi/12. In both cases \phi=0.
